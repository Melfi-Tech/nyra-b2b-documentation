## User Login

Authenticate existing users to access their Nyra Wallet accounts.

## How It Works

The login process follows these steps:

1. **User submits credentials** (email/username and password)
2. **System validates credentials** against stored user data
3. **JWT token is generated** upon successful authentication
4. **Token is returned** to the client for subsequent API calls

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
  Never store JWT tokens in localStorage or sessionStorage. Use secure HTTP-only cookies or in-memory storage for production applications.
</Warning>

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt
- Failed login attempts are rate-limited
- Sessions expire after 24 hours of inactivity
- Multi-factor authentication can be enabled for additional security
