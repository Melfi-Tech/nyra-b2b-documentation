## Authentication Tiers

### 1. User Authentication (JWT)
- **Purpose**: Manage businesses and create API clients
- **Method**: JWT tokens via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- **Scope**: Full access to business management operations

### 2. API Client Authentication
- **Purpose**: Access business data via API clients
- **Method**: Client ID + Client Secret authentication
- **Scope**: Limited access to specific business data
- **Headers**: `x-client-id` + `Authorization: Bearer <client_secret>`

## Security Features

- **Multi-factor authentication** for enhanced security
- **JWT tokens** for secure session management
- **Rate limiting** to prevent brute force attacks
- **Encrypted storage** of sensitive user data

## Getting Started

To begin using authentication in your application:

1. **Register a new user** using the registration endpoint
2. **Authenticate users** with the login endpoint
3. **Use the returned JWT token** for business management operations
4. **Create API clients** for your businesses to enable third-party integrations
5. **Use client credentials** for API client authentication

<Note>
  All authentication endpoints require HTTPS and follow OAuth 2.0 standards for security best practices.
