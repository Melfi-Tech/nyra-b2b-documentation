## Authentication Methods

### User Authentication
- **Method**: JWT token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- **Endpoint**: `/business/:businessId`
- **Scope**: User must own the business

### API Client Authentication
- **Method**: Client ID + Client Secret
- **Endpoint**: `/business/1/:businessId`
- **Headers**: 
  - `x-client-id`: Your client ID
  - `Authorization`: `Bearer <client_secret>`
- **Scope**: API client must be authorized for the business

## Security Notes

<Warning>
  Users can only access businesses they own. API clients have limited access based on their permissions.
</Warning>

- **Ownership Check**: Users can only access their own businesses
- **Client Authorization**: API clients must be properly configured for the business
- **Data Scope**: Both methods return the same business data structure
