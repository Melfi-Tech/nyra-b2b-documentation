## Overview
Webhooks provide real-time notifications for specific events related to business wallets, such as transfers and funding. Businesses must subscribe to each event type in the dashboard to receive corresponding webhook payloads. Webhooks are dispatched to configured HTTPS URLs, signed with HMAC-SHA256 using the webhook's secret for verification.

## Verification
- Use the `X-Nyra-Signature` header to verify each payload using the webhook secret available in your dashboard.

## Webhook Events
The system supports three webhook event types. When creating or editing a webhook in the dashboard, select the events you want to receive.

### Supported Events
- **`managed_wallet.funded`**: Triggered when a managed wallet is credited (e.g., via bank transfer or other funding methods).
- **`managed_wallet.transfer`**: Triggered when a transfer is initiated from a managed wallet to another account.
- **`managed_wallet.temporary_account_funded`**: Triggered when a temporary virtual account linked to a business wallet is funded.

## Subscription Requirement
To receive webhooks for any of the above events, a business must:
1. Create a webhook configuration from the dashboard.
2. Ensure the configured URL is a secure HTTPS endpoint capable of handling POST requests.

If a business does not subscribe to an event, no webhook will be dispatched for that event.

## Webhook Payloads
Each webhook payload follows a standard structure, with the `event` field indicating the event type and the `data` field containing event-specific details. Below are example payloads for each event type.

### `managed_wallet.funded` Payload

      "customer_name": "Alice Brown",
      "customer_email": "alice@brown.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## Retry Mechanism
If a webhook delivery fails (e.g., due to network issues or the recipient server returning a non-2xx status), the system attempts to redeliver the webhook up to **10 times** with the following retry intervals:

- **Attempts 1–5**: Exponential backoff starting at 30 seconds, doubling each attempt (30s, 60s, 120s, 240s, 480s), with a random jitter of up to 1 second.
- **Attempts 6–10**: Fixed intervals of 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours, respectively.

The retry process stops if a 2xx response is received or after the 10th attempt fails. Each attempt includes the same `X-Nyra-Signature` for verification.

## Resend Webhook
You can request a redelivery for a specific transaction from the dashboard. Provide the transaction reference and Nyra will attempt delivery to all configured URLs for your business.


## Best Practices
- **Verify Signatures**: Always verify the `X-Nyra-Signature` header using the webhook's secret to ensure payload authenticity.
- **Respond Quickly**: Return a 2xx status code within 10 seconds to avoid retries.
- **Idempotency**: Use the `reference` field to handle duplicate webhook deliveries.
- **Monitor Logs**: Check server logs for retry attempts if webhooks are not received.
