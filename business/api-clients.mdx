## API Client Management

API clients allow third-party applications to securely access your business data. Each business can have multiple API clients for different integrations or environments.

## Prerequisites

<Info>
  You must own the business and be authenticated with a valid JWT token.
</Info>

- Valid JWT token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Business ownership (you must be the creator of the business)
- Business must be registered and active

## Creating API Clients

<Steps>
<Step title="Authenticate">
  Ensure you have a valid JWT token for the business owner account.
  
  <Check>
  Token should be included in Authorization header.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Business">
  Select the business for which you want to create an API client.
  
  <Check>
  You can only create API clients for businesses you own.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Create Client">
  Send POST request to `/business/:businessId/api-clients` with app name.
  
  <Warning>
  The client secret is only shown once. Store it securely immediately.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Store Credentials">
  Save both client ID and client secret securely.
  
  <Check>
  These credentials enable third-party access to your business data.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## API Client Operations

### Create New API Client
- **Endpoint**: `POST /business/:businessId/api-clients`
- **Purpose**: Generate new client credentials for a business
- **Response**: Client ID and client secret (secret shown only once)

### Regenerate Client Secret
- **Purpose**: Update client secret if compromised
- **Process**: Same endpoint, regenerates secret for existing client
- **Security**: Old secret becomes invalid immediately

### View Client Details
- **Endpoint**: `GET /business/:businessId/api-clients`
- **Purpose**: Monitor API client usage and status
- **Security**: Client secret is never returned in responses

## Client Credentials

### Client ID
- **Format**: String identifier
- **Usage**: Included in `x-client-id` header
- **Security**: Can be shared publicly

### Client Secret
- **Format**: String secret key
- **Usage**: Included in `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` header
- **Security**: Must be kept confidential and secure

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Never share your client secret or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

- **Store securely**: Use environment variables or secure key management
- **Rotate regularly**: Regenerate secrets periodically
- **Monitor usage**: Check client activity and last used timestamps
- **Limit access**: Only create clients for trusted applications

## API Client Authentication

Third-party applications use client credentials to authenticate:

```bash
# Headers required for API client authentication
x-client-id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```
