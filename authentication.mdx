# Authentication

The Nyra Wallet API uses API Keys to authorize every request. You can view and manage your API keys from your Nyra Wallet dashboard.

Be sure to keep your API keys safe and secure as they carry many privileges. Do not post or share your API keys in publicly accessible environments or client-side.

## Getting Started

To use the Nyra Wallet API, sign up on the Nyra Wallet dashboard to create an API client and get your client ID and client secret.

## Authentication via API Client

Pass your API client credentials as headers in your request:

- `x-client-id`: Your client ID (required, string)
- `Authorization`: Bearer `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` (required, string)

### Example

```javascript
import axios from "axios";

axios.get("https://api.nyrawallet.com/v1/business/wallets", {
  headers: {
    "x-client-i
